<h1>SleepMonitors</h1>
Simple app to put all your monitors to sleep when executed.
</br></br>
Helpful if you're one of those people that needs to leave their PC running but doesn't want to wait for their screens to auto-sleep or have to physically turn them off everytime.
</br></br>

<h2>Usage:</h2>
Simply launch the executable and your monitors should go to sleep.<br>
A small message will display on screen telling you it's about to do so.<br>
This message can be hidden with a `-s` launch command like so: `SleepMonitors.exe -s`
